This is a trivial program to demostrate my skills in Qt multitreading. 
The program runs with 2 number arguments. Numbers amount to be generated with every thread. And a number of threads to generate numbers with. After generating, every thread, save results of its own in a shared SQLite DB. The last step shows how much numbers were generated with every thread. 
As for me, it works slow. But I don't see a reason and time to make in faster.
