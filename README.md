This is a very simple program made for demomtrate my skills with Qt multitreading. 
Programm runs with 2 arguments numbers amount that should be generated by every thread. And number of threads that generate numbers. After generating, every thread, save own results in shared SQLite DB. At last step shows how much '50' numbers was generated by every thread with SQL query. 
Now, as for me, works slow. But I not see reason and time make in faster. Just a quick solution for one time.
